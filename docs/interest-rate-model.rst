Interest rate model
===================

Bare theory
===========

From the *Exactly Finance: A Model for the Development of a Fixed Income Market on the Etherum network (v.0.1)* document:

    The model for interest rates as a function of the utilization ratio is described
    with a single continuous and differentiable function

.. math:: 

    R(U)=\frac{A}{(U_{max}-U)}+B

..

    This function diverges asymptotically when U â†’ U max and it acts as a
    natural barrier to the credit demand as the level of utilization depletes the
    protocol liquidity capabilities.

    :math:`A` and :math:`B` are determined from calibration against relevant market data.

.. math::

    R(U=0) = R_{0} = \frac{A}{U_{max}} + B

    R(U_{b}) = R_{b} = \frac{A}{(U_{max}-U_{b})}+B

..

    where :math:`U_{b}` represents the utilization level at the boundary of normal and leveraged interest rate regions.

.. math::

    A = \frac{U_{max}(U_{max}-U_{b})}{U_{b}}(R_{b}-R_{0})

    B = \frac{U_{max}}{U_{b}}R0+(1-\frac{U_{max}}{U_{b}})R_{b}

Aditionally,

- :math:`U` stands for the *utilization rate*, defined as

.. math::

    U = \frac{BM_{i}}{max(\frac{SS}{nMaturities},SM_{i})}

..

    - :math:`BM_{i}` total borrows at maturity :math:`i`
    - :math:`nMaturities` total number of maturities in a given ``Fixedlender``
    - :math:`SS` total supplied to the smart pool
    - :math:`SM_{i}` total supplied to maturity :math:`i`

- :math:`R_{0}` stands for the interest rate when the utilization rate (:math:`U`) is zero, meaning the rate that'll be charged to the first borrower of a maturity
- :math:`U_{b}` is the *boundary* utilization rate, at which the curve gets steeper, with the idea of having the interest rate naturally tend to :math:`R(U_{b})`. Anything *below* :math:`U_{b}` is considered *normal* and anything *above* is considered *leveraged*.
- :math:`R_{b}` is the aforementioned :math:`R(U_{b})`, the interest rate when :math:`U=U_{b}`

Examples
========

Let's say we want

- :math:`U_{b}`: 0.8
- :math:`U_{max}`: 1.1
- :math:`R_{0}`: 0.02
- :math:`R_{b}`: 0.14

So, replacing above, we'd end up with

.. code::

    A = ((Umax*(Umax-Ub))/Ub)*(Rb-R0)
    A = ((1.1*(1.1-0.8))/0.8)*(0.14-0.02)
    A = 0.04950000000000000000

    B = ((Umax/Ub)*R0) + (1-(Umax/Ub))*Rb
    B = ((1.1/0.8)*0.02) + (1-(1.1/0.8))*0.14
    B = -.02500000000000000000

- :math:`A = 0.0495`
- :math:`B = -0.025`

let's plot it:

.. plot::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    x=np.linspace(0,1.1, 100)
    y=map(lambda u: (0.0495/(1.1-u))-0.025, x)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, list(y))
    ax.set(xlabel='Utilization Rate', ylabel='Interest Rate')
    ax.set_ybound(lower=0, upper=0.8)
    ax.grid()
    plt.show()

Let's say we wanted to set a higher :math:`R_{0}` and have everything else remain the same:

- :math:`U_{b}`: 0.8
- :math:`U_{max}`: 1.1
- :math:`R_{0}`: 0.05
- :math:`R_{b}`: 0.14

.. code::

    A = ((Umax*(Umax-Ub))/Ub)*(Rb-R0)
    A = ((1.1*(1.1-0.8))/0.8)*(0.14-0.05)
    A = .03712500000000000000

    B = ((Umax/Ub)*R0) + (1-(Umax/Ub))*Rb
    B = ((1.1/0.8)*0.05) + (1-(1.1/0.8))*0.14
    B = .01625000000000000000

- :math:`A = 0.037125`
- :math:`B = 0.01625`

plot:

.. plot::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    x=np.linspace(0,1.1, 100)
    y=map(lambda u: (0.037125/(1.1-u))+0.01625, x)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, list(y))
    ax.set(xlabel='Utilization Rate', ylabel='Interest Rate')
    ax.set_ybound(lower=0, upper=0.8)
    ax.grid()
    plt.show()

Notes
=====

- A :math:`\beta_{M}` factor could be added to the computation of :math:`U`, multiplying the maturity pool deposits, if we intend to not offer all of the MP funds for borrowing

Unanswered questions
====================
Why is :math:`U` defined as:

.. math::

    U = \frac{BM_{i}}{max(\frac{SS}{nMaturities},SM_{i})}

and not as:

.. math::

    U = \frac{BM_{i}}{\frac{SS}{nMaturities}+SM_{i}}

if both SP and MP funds can be lent out simultanously?

Implementation checks
=====================


Security considerations
=======================
- We should set, either hardcoded or or at deploy time, the max/min values between which the :math:`A` and :math:`B` parameters will be valid to set in the normal contract's lifecycle.
